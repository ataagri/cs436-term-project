# Contact Management App - GCP Migration Guide

This document outlines the steps to migrate a simple contact management application to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using a production-ready architecture.

## Architecture Overview

The application uses the following GCP components:

- **Frontend**: React application hosted on Firebase Hosting with Firebase Authentication
- **Backend**: FastAPI application running on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL database on Cloud SQL
- **Monitoring**: Custom monitoring dashboard on a Compute Engine VM
- **Infrastructure**: Cloud Load Balancer and Cloud CDN for content delivery

## Migration Steps

Follow these steps in order to migrate the application to GCP:

1. [Project Setup](01-project-setup.md)
   - Create a GCP project
   - Enable required APIs
   - Set up Firebase
   - Set up Artifact Registry
   - Set up service accounts

2. [Cloud SQL Setup](02-cloud-sql-setup.md)
   - Create PostgreSQL instance
   - Create database and user
   - Configure connection
   - Set up SSL
   - Modify backend database configuration
   - Set up Cloud SQL Proxy for local development
   - Migrate data to PostgreSQL

3. [Containerize Backend](03-containerize-backend.md)
   - Create a Dockerfile
   - Create .dockerignore
   - Build and push Docker image
   - Test the Docker image locally
   - Update CORS configuration
   - Create Kubernetes deployment files

4. [GKE Setup](04-gke-setup.md)
   - Create a GKE cluster
   - Get credentials for the cluster
   - Apply Kubernetes configuration files
   - Create Ingress for external access
   - Create a static IP address
   - Set up a domain (optional)
   - Monitor deployment
   - Configure autoscaling

5. [Firebase Setup](05-firebase-setup.md)
   - Set up Firebase Authentication
   - Create a Firebase Web App
   - Install Firebase in the frontend project
   - Create Firebase configuration file
   - Create authentication components
   - Update App.js to include authentication
   - Update API calls with authentication
   - Deploy to Firebase Hosting

6. [Monitoring Setup](06-monitoring-setup.md)
   - Create a virtual machine instance
   - Set up firewall rules
   - Connect to the VM
   - Install required software
   - Set up Prometheus and Grafana
   - Install and configure Node Exporter on the backend VMs
   - Create a service for Node Exporter
   - Set up monitoring for Cloud SQL
   - Create custom dashboards in Grafana
   - Set up Nginx as a reverse proxy
   - Set up SSL with Let's Encrypt
   - Set up alerting

7. [Testing and Troubleshooting](07-testing-troubleshooting.md)
   - Test the complete application flow
   - Common troubleshooting
   - Performance testing
   - Security testing
   - Backup and recovery

## Application Flow

1. Users access the application through Firebase Hosting (https://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.web.app)
2. Authentication is handled by Firebase Authentication
3. Authenticated requests are sent to the backend API through Cloud Load Balancer
4. Backend API processes requests and communicates with Cloud SQL
5. All components report metrics to the monitoring dashboard

## Local Development

For local development:

1. Run the React frontend locally with Firebase Emulators:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

2. Run the FastAPI backend locally with Cloud SQL Proxy:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   CLOUD_SQL_PROXY=true uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

## Future Improvements

Potential future improvements to consider:

1. Implement CI/CD pipeline with Cloud Build
2. Add Cloud Armor for enhanced security
3. Implement GraphQL API with Apollo
4. Add Cloud Storage for file uploads
5. Implement real-time features with Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore
